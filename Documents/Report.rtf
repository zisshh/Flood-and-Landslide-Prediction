Flood Prediction\par
Abstract\par
\par
Natural disasters such as landslides and food shortages pose significant challenges, particularly in regions with complex topography and vulnerable populations. This study presents a machine learning-based approach to predict landslides and food insecurity in susceptible areas. By integrating various datasets, including historical weather patterns, soil composition, land use, topographical data, and socio-economic indicators, the model aims to provide early warnings and actionable insights. The landslide prediction model employs techniques such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks to analyze the likelihood of landslide occurrences, while the food prediction model leverages time-series analysis and regression techniques to forecast food production and potential shortages. The models are validated using real-world data from high-risk regions, and the results demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods. This approach has the potential to assist policymakers and disaster management agencies in proactive planning, thereby reducing the impact of these events on affected communities.\par
